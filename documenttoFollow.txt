	•	Enhancements
	•	AI Co-Pilot Banking: Personalized, proactive finance advisor chatbot.
	•	Biometric Blockchain Passports: Secure user identity across DeFi platforms.
	•	Universal Wallet Bridge: Cross-chain asset movement (Ethereum ↔ Solana).
	•	Dynamic Risk Adjuster: Real-time transaction limit adjustments based on AI confidence scores.
	•	Predictive Compliance Engine: Automated AML rule learning and adjustment using AI/ML models.
This formalizes KitBank.net’s innovation roadmap — translating cutting-edge fintech concepts into executable technical modules, ensuring long-term adaptability, security, and financial inclusion.

	•	Integration Framework

Illustrates KitBank’s external system integrations for cross-platform interoperability and automation. All APIs must include versioning and rate limiting (500 req/min max). Implement HMAC-SHA256 signatures for sensitive transactions. Use Swagger or Postman collections for documentation.
This defines how KitBank.net connects with external systems, ensuring cross-platform interoperability, secure API orchestration, and consistent data flow between internal and third-party services. All integrations follow API-first, secure-by-design principles and are governed by standard protocols and performance constraints.

	•	Overview
Each integration point is modular, versioned, and authenticated through centralized API Gateway controls.All APIs must:
	•	Use version tagging (e.g., /v1/, /v2/) for backward compatibility.
	•	Enforce rate limiting of 500 requests/min.
	•	Apply HMAC-SHA256 signatures on all sensitive transaction payloads.
	•	Include documentation via Swagger, Postman Collections, or OpenAPI 3.0 specifications.

	•	Integration Topology
All integrations flow through the API Gateway (Kong), which manages:
	•	Routing between internal services and external APIs.
	•	Rate limiting, caching, and authentication.
	•	Analytics on API usage and latency.
	•	Version management for backward compatibility.
Architecture Flow:
Client (Web/Mobile/Chat) → API Gateway → Integration Service (Microservice) → External Provider API → Database/Event Stream
Each integration has a dedicated microservice for isolation and fault recovery (e.g., crypto-service, kyc-service, payment-service).

	•	Workflow Automation & Orchestration Framework

This section defines how KitBank.net orchestrates all user interactions, business processes, and cross-service data flows using a workflow automation layer built on Camunda, Temporal.io, and Apache Airflow. It ensures every transaction, KYC update, API call, and AI-triggered workflow operates reliably, consistently, and in compliance with financial governance rules.
	•	BPMN (Camunda) Workflow Example: Loan Application Flow
Step Sequence Overview:
	•	User applies for loan → trigger Loan_StartEvent.
	•	KYC validation → ServiceTask: KYC_Verify.
	•	AI scoring engine → ServiceTask: AI_Score_Evaluate.
	•	Decision gateway: If score ≥ threshold → proceed; else → reject.
	•	Loan disbursement → ServiceTask: Fund_Transfer.
	•	Notify user → ServiceTask: Send_Notification.
	•	End event logged → EndEvent: Workflow_Complete.
Each step is tracked in Temporal.io history logs for replay and fault recovery.
